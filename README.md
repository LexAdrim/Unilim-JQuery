# A Web Application for scientific purpose 

This application was built to improve work on gaussian curves for a particular search subject. However the application is flexible enough to work with gaussian curves for various purposes. The application is in french. 

It features :
- Integration of your experimental curves
- Addition of custom gaussian
- Dynamic change
- Exportation of the points as a csv file
- Calculation of the error between experimental and theorical curve 
- Calculation of a coefficient to reduce the error
