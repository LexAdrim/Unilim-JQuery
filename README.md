# A Web Application for scientific purposes 

This application was built to improve work on Gaussian curves for a particular research subject at the [Limoges University](http://www.xlim.fr/) in France. However the application is flexible enough to work with gaussian curves for various purposes.The application is in French. 
The online app includes a sample experimental curve if you want to test the app.

It features :
- Integration of your experimental curves
- Addition of custom gaussian
- Dynamic change
- Exportation of the points as a csv file
- Calculation of the error between experimental and theorical curve 
- Calculation of a coefficient to reduce the error
