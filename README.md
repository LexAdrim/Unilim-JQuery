# A Web Application for scientific purposes 

This application was designed for a particular research subject at the [Limoges University](http://www.xlim.fr/) in France. The web application allows researchers to manipulate gaussian curves and experimental curves. The application is in French.

It features :

- Manipulation of gaussian curves
- Exportation of the points as a csv file
- Calculation of the error between an experimental and a theorical curve 
- A curve fitting algorithm allowing the fitting of theoretical curves to an experimental curve
